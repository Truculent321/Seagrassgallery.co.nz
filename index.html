    <h2>About the artist</h2>
    <img src="" alt="Selfie image" style height: 50px; margin: 5px;">
    <p>I think I was always supposed to be a painter.
It’s not until I retired from a busy life organising major public events in Wellington that I started to
take painting seriously.
You will see two basic styles of acrylic painting in the way I work. Some paintings are rendered in a
tight, geometric, exact way showing an understanding of objects and perspective, others are more
loosely created and happen more quickly. I shall keep going at both, perhaps until the louder voice
drowns out the other.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Seagrass Gallery is located at 38 Moana Street Otaki Beach New Zealand. It is open every Sunday
from October through March, 10am to 4pm (essentially the warmer months) or by appointment.
Around 30 works are on display at any one time, all priced and available for purchase. At the
moment all paintings are the work of Grant Stevenson, but as things develop, other artists will no
doubt join the Gallery. Prices reflect the fact purchases are made directly from the artist.</p>
